# PHEC Extra Plotting Macros

These macros are used to make extremely specific plots (e.g. the results
of the speed test macro). They should be used with caution since they
aren't guaranteed to work with gcc-4.8.5 or ROOT 5.34/36.

However, they are nonetheless included here as they're extremely useful
to working with the output of the plotter.
